His father died when de Valera was only two years old and his mother decided that her son would be better off at home in Ireland. </p><p>Little is known of his early childhood except that his family moved from America in 1885 to Ireland where the young Eamon studied at Blackrock College in Dublin and was largely reared by his Grandmother. He studied languages and mathematics and was, like Michael Collins, a student of English Rule in Ireland. The early 1900s was a time of the great Gaelic cultural revival in Ireland as literature, drama, sport and the language of the Gaelic nation were all revived.  </p></div><div class="item"><h4 class="heading">Adult Life</h4><p><img src="./img/eamon8.jpg" alt="Éamon de Valera" class="item-image" /><p>In 1908, he joined the Gaelic League, the beginning of his life-long devotion to Irish. One of his teachers was Sinead Flanagan, herself a teacher and four years his senior. They fell in love and were married in January 1910. De Valera joined the Irish Volunteers at their first meeting in 1913. He took part in the landing of guns from the Asgard in July 1914. He commanded the Bolands Mills garrison during the 1916 rising. </p><p>                    After the surrender he was sentenced to death, but later it was decided to sentence him to life imprisonment instead. In prison, de Valera began to show his leadership qualities. De Valera was released from prison in June 1917 and was elected Sinn Fein deputy for East Clare. At the Sinn Fein Ard-Fheis in October 1917, de Valera was elected President of the party and at the end of the same month he was elected President of the Irish Volunteers. When the British Government proposed to extend conscription to Ireland in early 1918, de Valera led the successful opposition to this proposal. On 17 May 1918, De Valera was arrested and deported for internment to England, where he was to remain up to February 1919.</p><p>                        While he was in jail he was elected for East Clare in the general election. On 21 January 1919, the assembled deputies met in the Mansion House, Dublin, and formally set up the Government for the Irish Republic. After his escape from Lincoln Jail on 3 February 1919, de Valera returned briefly to Ireland and was elected President of the Dail.</p></div><div class="item"><h4 class="heading">The creation of Fianna Fail </h4><img src="./img/eamon7.jpg" alt="Éamon de Valera" class="item-image" /><p> In May 1926 at a meeting in Dublin, de Valera founded a new political party called Fianna Fail. The aims of the party were:</p><ol><li>A united Ireland as a Republic.</li><li>To restore the Irish Language and develop the Irish culture.</li><li>To develop a social system where there is an equal opportunity for all.</li><li>To have a fair system of land distribution in Ireland.</li><li>To make Ireland as self-sufficient as possible, with a proper balance between agriculture and other industries. </li></ol><p>In November 1926, Fianna Fail held its first Ard-Fheis and de Valera was elected President of the new organisation. In the general election of June 1927, his party won 44 seats and Cumann na nGaedhael won 47 seats which was a large drop for them.</p><p>When de Valera and his fellow Fianna Fail deputies arrived at Leinster House, they were refused permission to take their seats unless they first took the oath. They then retired and Cumann na nGaedhael formed the government.</p><p>Fianna Fail, however, continued to campaign for the removal of the Oath. In order to spread their ideas, the Fianna Fail party founded a daily newspaper, the Irish Press, in September 1931.</p><p>Fianna Fail, supported by the Labour Party, formed a Government in 1932, having earlier overcome their objections to the Oath by simply signing a book containing the oath, which they declared an �Empty Formula�. In office, the party finally removed the oath by legislation in 1933.</p><br><br><p><a href="people.html" class="myButton">Back to People</a></p></div><h3 class="heading">More photos</h3><div class="columns "><div class="item"><img src="./img/eamon6.jpg" alt="Michael Collins" class="item-image" /></div><div class="item"><p><img src="./img/eamon3.jpg" alt="Michael Collins" class="item-image" /></p></div><div class="item"><img src="./img/eamon4.jpg" alt="Michael Collins" class="item-image" /></div></div><script src="js/script.js"></script></div><footer><a id="back2Top" title="Back to top" href="#">&#10148;</a><div class="container"><p>copyright James Moynihan</p></div></footer></body></html>
