                        The first evidence of human presence in Ireland dates to about 12,500 years ago, shortly after the receding of the ice after the younger Dryas cold phase of the Quaternary ended around 9700 BC.
                    </p>
                    <p> The Irish history recorded over the last 200+ years has been rich one, but fraught with many challenges including the Viking conquest, the Norman conquest, the Black Plague and Various famines, most notably the Great famine of 1843 to 1848.</p>
                    <p>The History of ireland can be measured by the tenacity and perservence of those alive during these harshest of periods. even before the foreign conquests, Irish kings and clans faught bitterly for power on the Island, which are reflected in the annals and history books that cover the subject. </p>
